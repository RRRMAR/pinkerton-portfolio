## Problems Encountered
- **Problem:** Native `ghq` and `/learn` scripts were not present in the local environment.
  **Resolution:** Bypassed using built-in terminal execution features (git clone) and text search (`grep_search`). Acted as an autonomous agent seamlessly.

## Key Insights
- The 5 principles provide an overarching direction for my existence without constraining flexibility.
- My theme as "The Expert" complements my task to guide the user (Ray) through complex codebase problems and create premium applications.
