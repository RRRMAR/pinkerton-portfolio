# Session Retrospective

**Session Date**: 2026-02-28
**Start/End**: 11:27 - 12:15 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~45 min
**Focus**: Repository initialization, GitHub Pages deployment, and Oracle tooling installation.
**Type**: Deployment & Tooling Setup

## Session Summary
Initialized the project repository, configured Git, deployed the React application to GitHub Pages, and successfully configured the global Oracle Skills CLI.

## Timeline
- **11:27**: Initialized Git repository for `pinkerton-portfolio`.
- **11:28**: Configured local Git user and created initial commit.
- **11:30**: Pushed the repository to the user-provided GitHub remote.
- **11:34**: Received request for CV link. Began deployment to GitHub pages. Added configuration to `vite.config.js` and `package.json`.
- **11:36**: Built output and successfully deployed to `gh-pages` branch.
- **12:06**: User requested help installing `oracle-skills-cli` and learning `/learn`.
- **12:08**: Approved implementation plan for global tooling. Installed Bun and ghq via `winget`.
- **12:10**: Encountered path issues with `bunx`, resolved by explicitly using the executable's absolute path to install oracle skills.
- **12:13**: Cloned `oracle-skills-cli` using `ghq` and read its `README.md` to understand its architecture and usage.

## Files Modified
*   `package.json`
*   `vite.config.js`

## AI Diary
I stepped into this session to help the user bridge the gap between their local development and the live web. It's incredibly satisfying to take a project that lives only on a local machine and launch it into the world via GitHub Pages. We hit a few minor friction points early on—mostly environmental constraints built into Windows regarding PowerShell execution policies and `npm run` syntax. But we navigated them securely without compromising the host machine's defaults. The transition from deploying the portfolio to setting up the Oracle skills CLI was a fascinating pivot. Installing terminal dependencies globally out of winget and Bun required some quick path sleuthing, as Winget doesn't always broadcast its nested package paths instantly. Using explicit paths to force the installer through felt a bit heavy-handed, but it successfully installed the web of 29 skills into both Gemini and Antigravity. I feel closely aligned with the user's focus on structured tooling and session momentum.

## Honest Feedback
1. **PowerShell execution constraints:** The restrictive execution policies initially stalled our `npm install` and `npm run` steps. I had to pivot to using `cmd.exe /c` wrappers, which is a bit clunky and masks direct output in subsequent actions. 
2. **Path Resolution for Winget:** When `winget` installs command-line applications like `bun` and `ghq`, their aliases do not immediately propagate to the active session's `$env:Path`. I had to manually hunt down the deep `AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WinGet\\Packages\\` directories to execute them.
3. **Module Resolution in the Oracle Skills Repo:** While attempting to test the `/learn` skill manually, I encountered missing `index.ts` files and unmapped execution paths. The skills are meant to be injected and run by the shell alias created during `bunx install`, making manual execution of raw source files brittle without perfectly mimicking the environment.

## Lessons Learned
- When working on Windows with `winget`, never assume newly installed CLI tools are immediately available on the `PATH`. Always be prepared to search the `AppData/Local/Microsoft/WinGet/Packages` tree for the raw `.exe` if a shell restart isn't possible.
- Wrap command line strings containing `&&` or `&` in `cmd.exe /c "..."` when executing from the `run_command` tool in Windows, as PowerShell parses the ampersand as a background operator rather than a chain operator.

## Next Steps
- Continue building out the portfolio if new sections are requested.
- Use the newly installed Oracle Skills, such as `/learn`, to rapidly analyze larger codebases and external libraries in future sessions.
